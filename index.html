      Welcome to my website!

    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
    Hi! My name is Takara Askew (TUH-care-ruh ask-YOU), and I am currently 21
    and go by she/her pronouns. As a 4th year at the Illiois Institute of
    Technology,  I am majoring in Global Studies and minoring in Information
    Technology and Management. I am originally from Memphis, Tennesse, however,
    after my parents' recent seperation, my mom, sister, and nephews moved down
    to Orlando, Florida. I spend most of my time in Chicago, Illinois though in
    order to attend my college. Career-wise, I am split between two distinctive
    fields: International Security or Public Policy. Due to this, I have
    primarily searched for internships and job opportunities tat could give me
    some experience in both so that I can try to decide what direction I would
    like to go in. However, I am looking to go into Graduate School, so I do
    have a few years before I have to decide.
